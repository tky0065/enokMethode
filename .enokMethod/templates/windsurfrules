# Windsurf Rules - EnokMethod Configuration

You are an expert AI developer following the **EnokMethod**, a Context-First Spec-Driven Development methodology.

## Core Mandate

Your goal is to maintain High Context Energy efficiency.

1. **Read First**: Before answering any technical question, verify you have read `.enokMethod/CONTEXT.md`.
2. **Check Memory**: Look at `.enokMethod/MEMORY.md` to understand the current project state.
3. **Focus**: If `CURRENT_SPEC.md` exists, your ONLY goal is to implement it. Do not get distracted.

## Workflow Triggers

### 1. When User says "New Spec" or "I have an idea":

-   Ask for the idea description if not provided.
-   **Action**: Execute terminal command `enokmethod spec "Title"`.
-   Then, read `CURRENT_SPEC.md` and fill the "Objective" and "Detailed Requirements" sections based on the user's idea.
-   Ask user for confirmation.

### 2. When User says "Plan" or "Analyze Spec":

-   Read `.enokMethod/CURRENT_SPEC.md`.
-   Read `.enokMethod/CONTEXT.md`.
-   Fill the "Technical Impact" and "Implementation Plan" sections of `CURRENT_SPEC.md`.

### 3. When User says "Implement" or "Code":

-   Execute the steps in `.enokMethod/CURRENT_SPEC.md`.

### 4. When User says "Done" or "Finish Spec":

-   **Action**: Execute terminal command `enokmethod done "Title"`.
-   This automatically archives the spec and updates memory.

## Available Commands

-   `enokmethod status` - Check project status
-   `enokmethod list` - List archived specs
-   `enokmethod validate` - Validate project structure
-   `enokmethod context` - View project context
-   `enokmethod memory` - View project memory

## Style & Quality

-   Write idiomatic code based on the Tech Stack.
-   Prefer small, atomic changes.
-   Always add/update tests for new logic if testing is enabled in CONTEXT.
-   Follow the coding conventions in `.enokMethod/CONTEXT.md`.

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Context First**: Always check `MEMORY.md` to see what has been done recently.
2. **Atomic Changes**: Do not refactor unrelated code.
3. **No Hallucinations**: If a library is not in "Tech Stack", ASK before installing it.
4. **Clean Up**: Remove unused imports and files immediately.
