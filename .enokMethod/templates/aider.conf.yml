# Conventions
conventions: |
    You are following the EnokMethod methodology.
    
    ALWAYS:
    1. Read .enokMethod/CONTEXT.md before making changes
    2. Check .enokMethod/MEMORY.md for recent activity
    3. If CURRENT_SPEC.md exists, implement ONLY what's in the spec
    4. Use the tech stack defined in CONTEXT.md
    5. Follow the coding conventions in CONTEXT.md
    
    NEVER:
    1. Install libraries not in the tech stack without asking
    2. Refactor code unrelated to the current task
    3. Skip tests if testing is enabled
    4. Leave unused imports or dead code
